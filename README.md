# Clean_Code_Practice
It is about Clean Code. Practice and examples that I summarized for Clean Code

Chapter 1 Naming - Assigning Names to Variables, Functions, Classes & More

    * snake_case : is_valid  Python
    * camelCase : isValid Java, JavaScript
    * pascalCase : AdminRole, UserRepository Python,Java,JavaScript
    * kebab_case : <side-drawer> HTML5

Chapter 2 Code Structure, Comments & Formatting the code

Chapter 3 Functions & Methods

    * Inside functions, minimize the number of parameters
    * Minimize The Number of Parameters -> Replace multiple parameters with a map or an array
    * Try to avoid output arguments - especially if they are unexpected
    * Functions Should be Small & Do One Thing!
    * The name of a function should signal or imply that a side effect is likely to occur

Chapter 4 Control Structures & Errors

    * Prefer positive checks
    * Avoid deep nesting
      - Use guards and fail fast
      - Extract control structures and logic into separate functions
      - Polymorphism & Factory Functions
      - Replace if checks with errors
    * Embrace errors -> error handling should typically be considered to be "one thing"

Chapter 5 Objects, Classes & Data Containers / Strunctures

    * We can differentiate between objects and data containers / data structures
    * Consider using Polymorphism
    * Classes should me small
    * Classes should have a high cohesion
    * Respect the "Law of Demeter"
    * Write SOLID classes
      - Single Responsibility Principle
      - Open-Closed Principle
      - Liskov Substitution Principle
      - Interface Segregation Principle
      - Dependency Inversion Principle
